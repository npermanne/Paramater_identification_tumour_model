# Simulation
This directory contains the tumour simulation core (`cell.py` and `grid.py`), a interface to interact with it (`simulation.py`), 
and finally the python script that create the different datasets (`dataset_generator.py`).
The parameters are generated in an interval defined in `parameter_data.csv`.
